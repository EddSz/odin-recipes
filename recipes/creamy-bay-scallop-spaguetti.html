    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This scallop pasta dinner with a creamy sauce is fast and easy. 
    <p>I cook the scallops a bit longer than many chefs, but that gives the dish more flavor and they're still tender and moist.</p>
         I think you'll agree, the sherry sauce benefits significantly from the longer cook time.</p>
